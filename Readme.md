Grymm WorldGrymm World is an iOS game written in Swift, featuring a rich narrative and immersive gameplay. This project uses storyboards and focuses on delivering a captivating experience through its various views.I started this project to further my understanding of good programming concepts rather to make a game that would actually be played. There are no images or assets in this project because I didn't want to get get bogged down with the standard game dev rigamarole.Table of ContentsFeaturesScreenshotsInstallationUsageContributingLicenseFeaturesInteractive Storytelling: Dive into the world of Grymm and interact with various NPCs through the NPC Dialog system.Battle System: Engage in battles using the BattleViewController to challenge enemies and progress through the game.Character Management: Use the CharacterSheetTableViewController to manage your character's stats and equipment.Exploration: Navigate through different rooms and environments using the RoomViewController.Credits: A dedicated CreditsViewController to showcase the creators and contributors of Grymm World.ScreenshotsInclude some screenshots of the different views here to showcase the UI and features of Grymm World.-=ViewControllers=-Initial View: Upon launching the game, users are greeted with the InitialViewController, which serves as the main menu of the game.
